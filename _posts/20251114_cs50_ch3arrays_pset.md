**Chapter 2 C PSet**

**Exercise 1:Figure out which type of sorting three different programs use based on a set of 50000 numbers either randomized, sorted, or reversed**

```C
Which program uses mergesort, bubble sort, and selection sort?

sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: because in the sorted set of numbers it run faster that sort3 since it only does a comparison n times since the numbers are sorted

sort2 uses: merge-sort

How do you know?: Shortest running time in randomized 50,000 number set.

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: it takes less time to run on the reversed set than sort 1 because it places numbers correctly at every switch 
```
